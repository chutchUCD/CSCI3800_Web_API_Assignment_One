There are 13 Headers. Primary description source 
for these is wikipedia's "List of HTTP header fields"
page with an additional URL to backup the information
on that page.

This page is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields , confirming references are listed with each heading.
Alt-Svc -> quic=".443", ma=2592000; v="35.34"
	A header that allows an http server to nominate
	an alternate service for responding to a request.
	An alternate service could be a different protocol
	or a different server or port.
	Ma is the max age in seconds. I don't have a reference
	for what quic or v means, I assume that quic refers to
	a common port.
	v could mean value or version, I'm not going to guess.

Cache-Control -> private, max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-transform
	private means this is intended for a single user and isn't
	supposed to be stored in a shared cache. A private cache can store it.
	Used to specify directives for caching in requests and responses.
	Only valid in one direction.
	Max age specifies the amount of time the header is valid, relative to the time
	of the request. Units is seconds.
	must-revalidate means that the cache must verify stale resources and should not
	use expired resources.
	no-transform means that no transformations or conversions should be made to the
	resource.

Content-Length -> 34139
	Size of the entity-body in "a decimal number of octets". In other words
	this is the number of bytes in a body.
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Length
Date -> Sun, 22 Jan 2017 19:20:57 GMT
	This is the time of the message origin.
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Date
ETag -> "vFp1TYDMppbWxVi0Wgw_upD83cI/a00HhsZQaiXhNpG3-ioLiltLcRg"
	Entity Tag. This is so that a server can check and make sure that
	the message is the same entity that it sent. In some circumstances
	multiple versions of a message can get sent, checking this tag allows
	a server to correctly compose the proper message in an efficient manner.
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag
Expires -> Sun, 22 Jan 2017 19:20:57 GMT
	This is the date when the message is considered junk data. Note that dates in
	the past like say, 0 mean that a message is already stale.

Server -> GSE
	Information about the server software used by the origin server
	to handle the request.
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Server
Vary -> Origin
Vary -> X-Origin
	The vary response header determines how to 
	match future request headers to decide
	whether or not the server should used a cached 
	request. Not sure what Origin and X-Origin refer to.
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Vary
X-Content-Type-Options -> nosniff
	Says "do not check the MIME type". Browsers check the MIME Type to
	determine what kind of file is being sent. Setting this to nosniff
	makes it so that the browser doesn't do this, which saves time and
	prevents the browser from possibly misinterpreting what a message is.
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options
X-Frame-Options -> SAMEORIGIN
	Specifies where a site can render frame, iframe and object elements.
	By specifying SAMEORIGIN this makes it so a site can only render
	those elements if they exist in the same site that is serving the page.
	A security method to prevent clickjacking.
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options
X-XSS-Protection -> 1; mode=block
	Used to check to see if a site contains inline, unsafe javascript.
	The first value makes the browser enable or disable protection.
	One means it is enabled. The mode argument tells the browser how to
	handle the xss attack. In this case the web browser will simply
	not render a page with a detected xss attack.
